# Word Puzzle Solver

The Word Puzzle Solver is a Java program that reads an 18x18 grid of characters from a text file and searches for specified words in eight different directions: right, left, upwards, downwards, left diagonally upwards, left diagonally downwards, right diagonally upwards, and right diagonally downwards. The program then displays the words it finds and their positions in the grid.

## How to Use

1. Compile and run the Java program in your preferred development environment or from the command line.

2. The program will load the word grid from the input text file and display it.

3. It will search for the specified words in the grid and display the results, including the words found and their positions.

4. The program will automatically close the input file and the display after finishing the search.

## Input File Format

The input file should contain the following data:

- The height of the grid (e.g., 18)
- The width of the grid (e.g., 18)
- The characters of the word grid (18x18 characters)
